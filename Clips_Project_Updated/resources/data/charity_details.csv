This should encourage students to be more design centric and more 'design educated'. Mobile Educational Exhibitions Program The Design Society will present a series of touring mobile educational exhibitions in the local tertiary and secondary schools. The exhibitions will present original theme and content based on it's design archive and local educational program. The exhibitions will serve as platforms to educate, inspire and interact. It is dedicated to bridging and connecting the local design community to the educators and students. The Design Society hopes to share and promote design knowledge and appreciation to the developing minds of Singapore's future generation. Singapore Design Archive The Design Society will launch a design archive to collect, preserve and document Singapore's design history and works. The ongoing collection will be easily accessible in order to facilitate understanding, research and writing in the field. Acknowledging its position as more than a static collection of material waiting to be discovered, The Design Society's Singapore Design Archive endeavours to be pro-active in instigating dialogue and critical thinking through the regular initiation of educational and public programs, and in introducing as wide an audience as possible to this rich resource. The archive's collection will be both physical and digital. An online archive gallery will be launched and maintained. Bi-Annual Public Exhibitions The Design Society will present 2 public exhibitions every year. The exhibitions will be open to the Society's members and public. The exhibitions will be presented in collaboration with local institutions and museums. The exhibitions will present original themes and content based on its design archive collection, international industry / institutional partnership, local educational program and annual design forum. The exhibitions will serve as platforms to educate, inspire and interact. The Design Society is dedicated to the conversation between the past and future of Singapore's design culture. Bi-Annual Design Publications One of the first priorities of the Society is to address the lack of a local publication dedicated to serious and professional discourse on graphic design. The proposed twice-yearly schedule will allow the editorial team to gather and follow through with research and reportage on major design events and projects. We intend for the inaugural issue to signal a new maturity in critical thinking and desire to raise our standards for design knowledge. Beginning with members of the Society, the publication will also be distributed to high profile individuals and leaders in related fields and industries in Singapore and across the Asia Pacific region. With the quality of content and a highly targeted audience, the publication is set to become an important milestone for the Singapore design scene",31-12-09,Live,Registered,http://www.thedesignsociety.sg
